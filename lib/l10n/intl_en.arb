  "whatIsFpv1": "First-person view (FPV) is a method where a radio-controlled aircraft (drone) is piloted remotely from a first-person perspective via an onboard camera, fed wirelessly to video FPV goggles.",
  "whatIsFpv2": "Freestyle FPV is all about flying skills and doing nice tricks or movements.",
  "whatIsFpv3": "Cinematic FPV content tends to be slower and smoother than Freestyle FPV. The settings are chosen more for their visual attraction than for the technical flying skills they demand.",
  "whatIsSpecialAboutFpv": "What is special about FPV?",
  "whatIsSpecialAboutFpv1": "The difference to normal drone pilots is that FPV pilots mostly build their drone(s) themselves.",

  "whatIsSpecialAboutFpv4": "Assembling the drone",
  "whatIsSpecialAboutFpv5": "Setting up the drone (Software)",
  "whatIsSpecialAboutFpv6": "Furthermore, it requires much more practice, since FPV drones are usually flown in acro mode (acrobatic mode: e.g. when releasing the control sticks, the drone does not automatically level itself or if you move the sticks forward, the drone will pitch forward continuously instead of accelerating forward...).",
  "whatIsSpecialAboutFpv7": "But the practice is worth it, because flying FPV is incredibly fun!",
